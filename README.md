MidiaStrimi born with the idea of watch movie from some websites without take a virus from any type of Ads. Actually the supported website are:

  - CB01 (Italian)
  - AltaDefinizone (Italian)
  - YesMovies (English)

#### .NET Core!

to keep this cross-platform we thought about using .NET Core that is already cross-platform (OSX, Linux, Windows) and we think to bring it on Android and IOS Devices.

#### What you can do actually?

Actually you can use it from CLI to:
  - Search movie from one of the 3 websites.
  - Retrieve media links.
  - Use it for stream/download.

Here a list of TODO:

- Implement GUI interface
- Extend with other website
