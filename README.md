[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/MikeCoder96/MidiaStrimi/issues)


MidiaStrimi born with the idea of watch movie from some websites without take a virus from any type of Ads. Actually the supported website are:

  - CB01 (Italian)
  - AltaDefinizone (Italian)
  - MovieWatcher (English) Incoming..
  - Primewire (English) Incoming..

#### .NET Core!

to keep this cross-platform we thought about using .NET Core that is already cross-platform (OSX, Linux, Windows) and we think to bring it on Android and IOS Devices in the future.

#### What you can do actually?

Actually you can use it from CLI to:
  - Search movie from one of the 3 websites.
  - Retrieve media links.
  - Use it for stream/download.

#### TODO

Here a list of TODO:

- Implement GUI interface
- Extend with other website
- Bypass hCaptcha & reCaptcha (FlareSolverr)
